// Introduction
// This section introduces the basic concepts of JavaScript programming.

// 1. JavaScript is a versatile programming language primarily used for web development, enabling dynamic and interactive elements on websites.

// 2. It runs on the client-side (in the browser) and allows for manipulation of HTML elements, handling user interactions, and making asynchronous requests to servers.

// 3. JavaScript is a high-level language with a syntax similar to other C-style languages, making it relatively easy to learn for beginners.

// 4. It supports various data types, including numbers, strings, booleans, objects, and arrays, and provides built-in functions and methods for common operations.

// 5. With JavaScript, developers can create and enhance web applications, implement complex algorithms, and build interactive user interfaces for a wide range of devices.
